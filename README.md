# Numbers Client Application

This project is my first attempt at developing a frontend client application using **Angular** and **JavaScript**. It demonstrates interaction with my backend API (`numbers-api`) which processes and classifies numbers.

## Features

- **User Input**: A simple input field that captures numbers as strings (e.g., `"10"`, `"11"`).
- **Real-time Processing**: Implements `inputChange` functionality to send requests to the backend API as the user types.
- **Number Classification**: Displays numbers classified into three categories based on API response:
  - Natural Numbers
  - Whole Numbers
  - Real Numbers
- **Clear Functionality**: A **Clear** button to reset the input and results, enabling a fresh start for new inputs.

## Current Status

- The frontend is currently under active development.
- Further improvements are planned for:
  - Enhanced usability and user experience
  - Input validation and error handling
  - UI and design refinements
