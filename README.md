# Client of API Numbers

This project is my first attempt at developing a frontend client application using Angular and JavaScript. It demonstrates interaction with my backend API(numbers-api) that processes and classifies numbers.

##Features
-A simple user interface with an input field that captures numbers (currently accepted as strings, e.g., "10", "11").

-Real-time input handling with inputChange functionality to send requests to the backend API.

-Displays the classification of numbers into Natural, Whole, and Real categories based on the API response.

-Includes a Clear button to reset the input and displayed results, allowing the user to start a new session easily.

##Current Status
-The frontend is currently under active development and needs further enhancements for usability, validation, and UI improvements.
