# Client of API Numbers

This project is my first attempt at developing a frontend client application using Angular and JavaScript. It demonstrates interaction with my backend API(numbers-api) that processes and classifies numbers.

For development purposes, the input format currently accepts numbers as strings (e.g., "10", "11"). The frontend is still under active development and will require further improvements and refinements.
